API DOCUMENTATION

------------------------------
API URL Format
------------------------------
For the locally hosted database, the base URL is "localhost:3000/api" followed by the resource you are trying to access.

Each table in the database schema is considered a resource. The resoruces include:

/user
/product
/cart
/cartitem

Note: Some routes may be restricted after auth is added.

------------------------------
GET endpoints
------------------------------

GET /<resource>
- Returns the complete table for the requested resource.
- This may be used for any resource.

GET /<resource>/<resourceId>
- Returns the resource with the primary key (ID) in the request.
- This may be used for any resoruce EXCEPT cartItem, which has no primary key.

GET /user/<userId>/cart/current
- Returns a cart for the given user ID number with cartStatus 'current'.
- For each user, there should only be one cart with cartStatus set to 'current' at a time.
