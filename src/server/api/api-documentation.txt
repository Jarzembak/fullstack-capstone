API DOCUMENTATION

------------------------------
API URL Format
------------------------------
For the locally hosted database, the base URL is "localhost:3000/api" followed by the resource you are trying to access.

Each table in the database schema is considered a resource. The resoruces include:

/users
/products
/cart
/cart-items

Note: Some routes may be restricted after auth is added.

------------------------------
Endpoints - General
------------------------------
GET /<resource>
- Returns the complete table for the requested resource.
- This may be used for any resource.

GET /<resource>/<resourceId>
- Returns the resource with the primary key (ID) in the request.
- This may be used for any resoruce EXCEPT cartItem, which has no primary key.

------------------------------
Endpoints - User
------------------------------
GET /users/<userId>/cart
- Returns a cart for the given user ID number with cartStatus 'current'.
- For each user, there should only be one cart with cartStatus set to 'current' at a time.
- Also returns cartItems associated with the cart.

GET /users/<userId>/cart/history
- Returns all carts for the given user ID number.
- Effectively, this looks up the user's order history.
- Also returns the cartItems associated with each cart.

POST /user
- Create a new user.
- Role flags such as isAdmin default to false, and should be adjusted after creation.

PUT /user/<userId>
- Updates the data of a single user ID.
- The request body must contain a fully formed user object with all required fields, changed or not.
    * For later versions: there may be a better way.
- Not currently set up to update roles.

------------------------------
Endpoints - Cart
------------------------------
GET /cart/<cartId>/items
- Returns all cartItems associated with the cart ID number.
- For administrative purposes only; users will normally access their carts through their accounts.

POST /cart
- Creates a new cart.
- Must be used AFTER checkout, with the previous cart's cartStatus changed from 'current'.
- Assigns 'current' cartStatus automatically.

PUT /cart/<cartId>
- Updates the data of a single cart ID.
- A cart's user never changes.
- Remember to update cartItem quantities separately.
